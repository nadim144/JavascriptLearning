Base on image below let's we understand what it is <b> client side script :</b> Let's take an example suppose any visitor/person want to visit yours or other website or webapplication. so, visiting request by visitor will hit to server first and than server will check any scripting is implemented (means: script file) to this website/webapplication, if 'yes' than server will do deploy all scripting file of respective website or WebApplication to browser from which it has been requested. Because all the fuctionality is written into javascript for client browser.</p>

        <p><b>Server side script:</b> This script will only run on server not on any client browser, it only provide HTML to browser after doing their all work. </p>
